                            Gian Lorenzo (or Gianlorenzo) Bernini was an 
                            Italian sculptor and architect. 
                            While a major figure in the world of architecture, 
                            he was, also and even more prominently, the leading 
                            sculptor of his age, credited with creating the 
                            Baroque style of sculpture. As one scholar has commented, 
                            "What Shakespeare is to drama, Bernini may be to s
                            culpture: the first pan-European sculptor whose name 
                            is instantaneously identifiable with a particular 
                            manner and vision, and whose influence was inordinately 
                            powerful...." In addition, he was a painter (mostly small 
                            canvases in oil) and a man of the theater: he wrote, 
                            directed and acted in plays (mostly Carnival satires), 
                            for which he designed stage sets and theatrical machinery. 
                            He produced designs as well for a wide variety 
                            of decorative art objects including lamps, tables, 
                            mirrors, and even coaches.
                            As an architect and city planner, he designed 
                            secular buildings, churches, chapels, and public 
                            squares, as well as massive works combining both 
                            architecture and sculpture, especially elaborate 
                            public fountains and funerary monuments and a whole 
                            series of temporary structures (in stucco and wood) 
                            for funerals and festivals. His broad technical 
                            versatility, boundless compositional inventiveness 
                            and sheer skill in manipulating marble ensured that 
                            he would be considered a worthy successor of 
                            Michelangelo, far outshining other sculptors of 
                            his generation. His talent extended beyond the 
                            confines of sculpture to a consideration of the 
                            setting in which it would be situated; his ability 
                            to synthesize sculpture, painting, and architecture
                             into a coherent conceptual and visual whole has been 
                             termed by the late art historian Irving Lavin the 
                             "unity of the visual arts".
                            <br>
                             Bernini’s career began under his father, 
                             Pietro Bernini, a Florentine sculptor of some 
                             talent who ultimately moved to Rome. The young 
                             prodigy worked so diligently that he earned the 
                             praise of the painter Annibale Carracci and the 
                             patronage of Pope Paul V and soon established 
                             himself as a wholly independent sculptor. He was 
                             strongly influenced by his close study of the 
                             antique Greek and Roman marbles in the Vatican, 
                             and he also had an intimate knowledge of High 
                             Renaissance painting of the early 16th century. 
                             His study of Michelangelo is revealed in the 
                             St. Sebastian (c. 1617), carved for Maffeo 
                             Cardinal Barberini, who was later Pope Urban VIII 
                             and Bernini’s greatest patron.
