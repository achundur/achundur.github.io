        <p>INT. STUDY ROOM - DAY
        <br>
        Two kids sit side by side in front of the desktop computer, crammed together as close as the chairs will allow.
            The girl, a few years older, sits on the left, her fingers on the A, W, and D keys. The boy hovers over the arrow keys.
        </p>
        <p>GIRL <br>
        Quick, quick- watch the lava!! Ok good, now get to the lever so I can get through.</p>

        <p>BOY <br>
        Yeah yeah hold on.</p>

        <p>Keys clack. The cameras pans up to the computer screen. The URL reads "coolmathgames.com." 
            Below is a cavern filled with lava and water traps, and filled with red and blue glowing diamonds.
            Watergirl and Fireboy move through the cavern, leaping over the lava and pushing levers to help each other 
            cross traps.
        </p>

        <p>
            at the bottom level, Fireboy easily crosses the lava pit. Watergirl runs to make the jump, but falls just short and evaporates.
        </p>

        <p>
            GIRL<br>
            Oops....wanna go again?
        </p>
        <p>
            BOY <br>
            Yeah fine but don't mess up this time.
        </p>

        <p>
            The theme music plays again as they reset the level.
