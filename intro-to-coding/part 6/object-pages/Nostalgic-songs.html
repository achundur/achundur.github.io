                    Songs - they‚Äôre associated with whoever I listened to them with or the phase of life I was in / whatever I was going through while listening to them 
                </p>

                <p>
                    My older bro would play Numb by Linkin Park on the way to our swimming lessons when I was around 8 years old - that song will always be associated with that and is very nostalgic bc of it. Another example of a nostalgic song: in Seattle when we would visit my aunt, we would always sit and listen to Sufi music and Jagjit Singh‚Äôs music, specifically his song Hothon Se Chhu Lo Tum, so it‚Äôs very nostalgic and associated with my parents and aunt sipping wine while we ran around causing havoc üòç                </p>
