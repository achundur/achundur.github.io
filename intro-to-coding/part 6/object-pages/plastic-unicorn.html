                <h3>Memory:</h3>
                <p>
                    - I went to a very small, Montessori school built out of a former church #midwest #ohio-- at largest, the school was maybe 75 kids. When I was in their 'Adolescents' classroom (for 7th and 8th graders), I was taught English/Latin/History by Mrs.K who was one of our two teachers. We all basically shared one large classroom that held all the things we needed, had personal cubbies in a sideroom, and then a large kitchen that we did home ec in. ANNNNYWAYS~ I apologize for, but pair these two items together, bc Mrs.K was an extremely important teacher to me and one day, I arrived early for class & when I looked in my cubby! there were two small gifts she had left for me there. She had gone to a garage sale over the weekend and found a porcelain indigo mug with my birthname (Gabrielle) on it and daisies on the side, alongside a small flexible, plastic figurine of a white unicorn. She said she'd seen them and thought of me :"""" --)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    - and i remember sitting and drinking hot tea on the couches in our reading corner and looking at the snow / watching her sit at her desk and knit socks while holding my little unicorn fig . . .
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    - whenever i see either of these, i think about that time of my life and being 12/13 and feeling just INSAAAAANE the way u do at that time/puberty/beginning 2 like actually form a human identity . . . she was always rly sweet to me and took me and my aspirations seriously + always saw a lot of potential in my work and these gifts felt emblematic of the kind of bond we had then ! on this same day, she also learned i'd never had homemade rice krispies before and the following week, she brought ingredients and alongside the rest of my (like . . 6 kid class) we made some and ate them in our tiny classroom .. . the objects themselves just really pull me back to being young and uncertain and sheltered/uncertain/hopeful, but most of all it makes me remember how loved i was at the time without really knowing it :""""""--) Mrs.K really believed in and rooted for me and helped me grow a love of comics, literature, creative projects, and a whoooole lot . . so seeing those gifts from her makes me really happy
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    - also, i feel i should say she isnt like dead or anything, im writing about her like she cant be reached anymore because one day she got tired of it all, moved to the woods to be in a cabin + spend her days reading 2 her grandkids and can't be reached by email or phone anymore . wonderful lady ."
