                    my DS was the first and only video game console i owned as a kid, and animal crossing wild world was my first game. this was back in 3rd grade and i still have it today! i moved around a lot as a kid so animal crossing was something i could go to for a moment of peace and sense of control. the game makes you feel so special and important with all your mortgages and responsibilities- thatâ€™s all really kid could ask for! i played it again when i went back home a few years ago and finally collected all the bugs after like 15 years. never been so proud of myself
