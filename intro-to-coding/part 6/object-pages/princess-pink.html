                    My mom used to tell me a bedtime story she made up whenever I was feeling down. It was about a brave princess who donned hot pink armor to fight the dragon that none of the princes could defeat. The dragon saw himself in her armor’s reflection and cried because his internalized misogyny made him so embarrassed to be pink (the armor distorted his reflection). But he and princess pink worked through that and she helped him realize his true dream which was to own a pancake stand! And she continued to act as the brave defender of her kingdom pink and all! Silly and lovely and lots of empowerment for a little girl:) I drew the story up into a book when I was about 10 but I think it’s been lost to time
