                <p>
                    i was obsessed with pokefarm from when i was around 9-11 years old. i would spend hours clicking on other people's parties (giving each pokemon different kinds of berries based on their preferences) and roleplaying warrior cats in the forums, except with pokemon. this is where i first learned how to use bbcode, html, and a touch of css combined with mspaint, because users would post with custom templates and i wanted to be like them. i remember there was a lot of drama over how the admin of the site (kolink/adam) ran it which for some reason impressed deeply on me as a kid
