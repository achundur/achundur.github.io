                    The 2005 era of gameboy pokemon games (fire red/leaf green/sapphire/ruby/ but most importantly, EMERALD)

                <h3>Memory:</h3>
                <p>
                    I put in several hundred hours into these games when i was in elementary school. They are, as close as I’ve seen, the perfect games. The music, the story, the gym puzzles. I have many fond memories playing the pokemon games as a child, but perhaps one of the most salient was when I was battling my rival before school, while my mom was yelling at me to turn off the game so we could leave (this was before you could pause a game mid-fight sequence). I had already lost this battle so many times, and I knew this was the time I would win: I had done the requisite level grinding and had landed a couple lucky critical hits early in the battle. I couldnt walk away, not now, when victory was so close. My mom and I screamed back and forth, as I mashed buttons at full speed, trying desperately to finish the battle and save my progress before my mom seized the gameboy from my delicate hands and turned it off. After that point, there was no more gameboy or TV before school for the rest of my career. I’d still do it all again.
