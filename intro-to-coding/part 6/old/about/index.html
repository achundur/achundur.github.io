                <p>"Nostalgic Objects" was an informal survey sent out July 2024. Participants were asked "What is your favorite 'nostalgic' item?"
                    Objects could be in any medium or format, including but not limited to physical objects, web experiences, songs, shows, games, old school assignments, etc.
                    The only limitations were that participants must have actually interacted or used these objects before.

                    "Nostalgic Objects" is part of a larger project by Adhiti C and Eileen L aiming to understand how current media and objects will 
                    last beyond this era. We hope to understand this through the ideas of social memories, archives, and 
                    why certain objects persist

                <p> I find profound inspiration in the power of visual storytelling. Through my collection of images transformed into the webzine archive "Traces of Time," I embark on a journey to explore the shared narrative of humanity. With a relentless pursuit of moments frozen in time, I curate a rich tapestry of diverse images, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in an immersive and thought-provoking experience. </p>
