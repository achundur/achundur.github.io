                    For us, fermentation was a crucial component to “extend the shelf life of 
                    perishable food” (Swain 2014, 3). The preservation aspect of 
                    fermentation acted as yet another force impacting human’s lifestyle. 
                    By safely preserving  perishables, we were able to store and 
                    eat these foods out of season and in times of scarcity 
                    (Campbell-Platt 2003, 630). Based on archaeological evidence, 
                    chemicals found in Neolithic vessels indicate that these ancestors 
                    had been intentionally fermenting and storing food such as fruit, 
                    honey, and rice (Selhub 2014, 1) as early as 10,000 years ago. 
                    This safe way of storing perishables was especially useful for 
                    survival during the winter season and during periods of drought 
                    (Swain 2014, 1).

                    "The milk of camels, goats, sheep, and cattle was naturally 
                    fermented as far back as 10,000 BCE. It’s likely that 
                    the fermentation occurred spontaneously, rather than 
                    intentionally, due to naturally existing microflora 
                    present in the milk.

                    It has been suggested that the first yogurts were produced 
                    in goat bags draped over the backs of camels in the heat of 
                    North Africa, where temperatures around 110°F during the day 
                    made ideal conditions for fermentation to occur."

                    While we developed adaptations from cooking that allowed us 
                    to become primarily land-mammals, we simultaneously lost 
                    the anatomical features that enabled us to easily climb 
                    trees. As a result, we ate fruits that were already on the 
                    ground- food that had probably begun to ferment (Peters 13). 
                    We had to use different strategies to  gather the food that 
                    we needed. In general, other animals avoided the “rotting” 
                    or older food that had begun to ferment, so with less 
                    competition our ancestors turned to these fermented foods 
                    as a “fallback” strategy (Carrigan 2014, 1). In turn, there 
                    was a “selective pressure that increased the tolerance of 
                    dietary alcohol before human-directed fermentation” 
                    (Peters 2019, 13).
